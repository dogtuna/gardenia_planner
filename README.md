# Interactive Fall Garden Plan

This repository contains a single-page web application for planning a fall vegetable garden. The interface includes an interactive planting timeline, garden bed layouts, a plant library, and a step-by-step action plan. A button in the "Seeds to Order" section lets you download a text file with any seeds you still need to buy.

## Opening `index.html`

1. Ensure you have a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser. No build process is required.

An internet connection is needed because the page loads Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, fonts from public CDNs, and now fetches location details and average first frost dates from external APIs when you change your ZIP code.

## Prerequisites

- A web browser released in the last few years.
- Internet access to load the external JavaScript and CSS libraries used by the page.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Fork the repository, create a branch for your changes, and open a pull request. Please ensure your code follows standard HTML and JavaScript best practices.
